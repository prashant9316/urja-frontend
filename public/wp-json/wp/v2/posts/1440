It has sold 1028 machines in 2021 so far to strengthen its position as the UK\u2019s fastest-growing and best-selling electric powered two-wheeler (e-PTW) brand.<\/p>\n<p>The achievement comes on the back of a strong 18 months for both Super Soco and electric motorcycle sales overall. This has been driven partly by consumers seeking a safer way to travel during the pandemic, coupled with an increase in environmental awareness and the desire for zero emission urban transport that is both properly legislated, and which \u2013 thanks to removable batteries \u2013 doesn\u2019t rely on the existing public charging infrastructure.<\/p>\n<p>In 2020, <a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcia.co.uk\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>Motorcycle Industry Association (MCIA)<\/strong><\/a> figures showed that e-PTW registrations were 51.2% up on the previous year, while Super Soco\u2019s own sales have increased by a huge 478% in 2021. The brand is leading the charge in the electric category, accounting for an impressive 26.78% of all e-PTW registrations for the year-to-date. The 125cc-equivalent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/cpx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CPx maxi scooter<\/strong><\/a> is the UK\u2019s best-selling electric machine, with 698 units registered so far this year, while the <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/tc-max\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TC Max caf\u00e9-racer style motorcycle<\/strong><\/a> has enjoyed a 70% increase in sales compared to 2020.<\/p><\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/section><div class=\"soco-large-image\">\n\t<div><img loading=\"lazy\" alt=\"Super Soco surpass 1000 unit sales in a year\" src=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006.jpg\" srcset=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006-300x200.jpg 300w, https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006-768x512.jpg 768w, https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006-1536x1024.jpg 1536w, https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/09\/Super_Soco_006-1501x1000.jpg 1501w\" width=\"2500\" height=\"1666\" \/><\/div>\n<\/div><section class=\"rich-text\">\n\t<div>\n\t\t<div><p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.mcia.co.uk\/press-statistics\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>MCIA statistics<\/strong><\/a> also show that Super Soco \u2013 which was only launched in the UK in 2017 \u2013 is ranked as the 17th best-selling powered two-wheeler brand overall, beating well-established petrol-powered giants such as Aprilia and Husqvarna. With the Department for Transport banning the sale of all new petrol motorcycles from 2035, the increasing appearance of electric marques in the best-selling list could signify that the gradual shift to e-PTWs is already underway.<\/p>\n<p>With five 100% electric models in the Super Soco line-up, ranging from the entry-level 50cc-equivalent twist and go <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/cux\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CUx scooter<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/tsx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TSx motorcycle<\/strong><\/a> to the 125cc-equivalent <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/cpx\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>CPx maxi scooter<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/tc\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TC<\/strong><\/a> and <a href=\"https:\/\/www.supersoco.co.uk\/bike\/tc-max\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><strong>TC Max motorcycles<\/strong><\/a>, there\u2019s something for every urban commuter\u2019s needs.

No electric powered-two wheeler brand has ever sold this many units in a single year before and it really goes to prove that the shift from petrol to electric is beginning to take hold. Our particular focus is of course on urban mobility and the fact that Super Soco offers an efficient, affordable, convenient and zero emission way of travelling in towns and cities right now, without major safety concerns or the worry that public infrastructure doesn\u2019t support it. It\u2019s a no-brainer for environmentally-aware commuters and we\u2019re happy that the message is now translating into real life situations\u201d<\/em><\/p><\/div>\n\t<\/div>\n<\/section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Super Soco has become the first-ever electric motorcycle and scooter brand in the UK to sell over 1000 units in a single year, showing that there is an increasing desire for zero emission urban transport that is convenient, reliable and safe.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":1442,"comment_status":"closed","ping_status":"closed","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":[],"categories":[1],"tags":[8,22,7,19,5,30,9,6],"yoast_head":"<!-- This site is optimized with the Yoast SEO plugin v19.0 - https:\/\/yoast.com\/wordpress\/plugins\/seo\/ -->\n<title>1000 unit sales record marks the biggest milestone yet!
